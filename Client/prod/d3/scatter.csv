Though this is going to be discussed in coming weeks, do look for Eric Mazur and Peer Instruction in the internet.\n\nNow from a learners perspective the assignments or activities are more useful for me if there is ""pertinency"" associated with it. i.e. there should be a relevance for the assignment in their immediate practice. \n\nLets take 2 examples and see whether this is making sense. I would really like to hear your views about this.\n\nExample 1 - For the topic on Eucledian distance that was discussed in the videos, will an assignment like ""Given physical map of the locality, convert it into cartesian coordinates and identify the shortest distance from your house to school. Use the location of the school as zero reference point (0,0)""\n\nAs a learner the exercise of converting a map to cartesian coordinate system and then trying to find out shortest path is interesting and also relevant. Since there is personalization (distance from my house to school) the ""Xeroxing"" effect is not useful. And again I will know various ways in which I can go to school, and also know the shortest way in which I can reach it (On days when I do not want to reach school fast, I know various other ways to take !!!). \n\nExample 2 - Consider this course's peer assessment activity where you have to write a learning objective and grade 2 others based on the criteria of validity, specificity and measurability.\nQuestion to others - Is it making the activity relevant?

Does this mean my response has not been recorded? How can I\n   understand whether my response has been recorded?\n\n*Ans*: No, if you have filled the survey once, at the end you will receive the following response message:  **Your response has been recorded. Now please proceed with the course.**  If you get this it means that survey is complete.\n\n##Regarding process for registering for certificate##\n\n\n----------\n\n - The survey says that I will receive an email from outreach team. When\n   will I get it?\n\n*Ans*: Certificate generation is a separate process and it will take some time for the outreach team to process all the data. So it will take 1-2 working days (we are trying to minimize it as far as possible). So please be patient, the mail will reach you this week itself.\n \n\n - Is there a format for approval letter from Head of Institution? Can\n   you upload a template?\n\n*Ans*: At this moment we do not have a template for the same. However the following points should be taken care while creating the approval letter:\n\n 3. The letter should be in the institute letter head and should have the sign and seal of the head of institution.\n\n 4. The letter should specify your full name and your department and should certify you as a bonafide faculty of the institution.\n\n 5.

1310,126376,"Incompressible flow equation[edit]\nIn most flows of liquids, and of gases at low Mach number, the density of a fluid parcel can be considered to be constant, regardless of pressure variations in the flow. Therefore, the fluid can be considered to be incompressible and these flows are called incompressible flow. Bernoulli performed his experiments on liquids, so his equation in its original form is valid only for incompressible flow. A common form of Bernoulli's equation, valid at any arbitrary point along a streamline, is:\n\n{v^2 \over 2}+gz+{p\over\rho}=\text{constant}\n \n \n \n \n(A)\nwhere:\n\nv\, is the fluid flow speed at a point on a streamline,\ng\, is the acceleration due to gravity,\nz\, is the elevation of the point above a reference plane, with the positive z-direction pointing upward – so in the direction opposite to the gravitational acceleration,\np\, is the pressure at the chosen point, and\n\rho\, is the density of the fluid at all points in the fluid.\nFor conservative force fields, Bernoulli's equation can be generalized as:[9]\n\n{v^2 \over 2}+\Psi+{p\over\rho}=\text{constant}\nwhere ? is the force potential at the point considered on the streamline. E.g. for the Earth's gravity ? = gz.\n\nThe following two assumptions must be met for this Bernoulli equation to apply:[9]\n\nthe flow must be incompressible – even though pressure varies, the density must remain constant along a streamline;\nfriction by viscous forces has to be negligible.\nBy multiplying with the fluid density \rho, equation (A) can be rewritten as:\n\n\n\tfrac12\, \rho\, v^2\, +\, \rho\, g\, z\, +\, p\, =\, \text{constant}\,\nor:\n\n\nq\, +\, \rho\, g\, h\,\n  =\, p_0\, +\, \rho\, g\, z\,\n  =\, \text{constant}\,\nwhere:\n\nq\, =\, \tfrac12\, \rho\, v^2 is dynamic pressure,\nh\, =\, z\, +\, \frac{p}{\rho g} is the piezometric head or hydraulic head (the sum of the elevation z and the pressure head)[10][11] and\np_0\, =\, p\, +\, q\, is the total pressure (the sum of the static pressure p and dynamic pressure q).[12]\nThe constant in the Bernoulli equation can be normalised. A common approach is in terms of total head or energy head H:\n\nH\, =\, z\, +\, \frac{p}{\rho g}\, +\, \frac{v^2}{2\,g}\, =\, h\, +\, \frac{v^2}{2\,g},\nThe above equations suggest there is a flow speed at which pressure is zero, and at even higher speeds the pressure is negative. Most often, gases and liquids are not capable of negative absolute pressure, or even zero pressure, so clearly Bernoulli's equation ceases to be valid before zero pressure is reached. In liquids – when the pressure becomes too low – cavitation occurs. The above equations use a linear relationship between flow speed squared and pressure. At higher flow speeds in gases, or for sound waves in liquid, the changes in mass density become significant so that the assumption of constant density is invalid.",0.05380681818181817,0.4148863636363636

Should I answer all the 5 questions for this activity?\n\n*Ans*: No you need to answer only the question relevant to your domain.\n\n - Q2. How will I do the Peer Assessment activity?\n\n*Ans*: Please refer to the [Peer Assessment Instructions][1] document that has been updated in the Course Info page to understand how to perform the activity.\n\n - Q3. The marking shows that I have 6/45, whereas problem score indicates 6/9. So which is the right one?\n\n*Ans*: The section contains 5 questions which are of 9 mark each. Hence the total maximum mark possible from the section is 45. Since you are answering only the question (related your domain) your answer is actually evaluated out of 9 possible marks for the question. \nPlease note that, the TPS activity is a mandatory activity to answer the Resource Creation assignment only.

2725,114268,"TPS activity promotes student learning through a sequence of three phases. First, students individually reflect on subject matter, then pair with a partner in class to discuss the information, and finally share ideas from their discussions with the class as a whole. TPS is believed to not only enhance student learning but it also engages all students in discussions, including those who may be more reserved and less likely to share unprompted in class. Instructors may be able to assess how students understand the material by walking around to listen in on various group reflections before then facilitating a larger class discussion. The use of simple online tools, such as Google Drive may provide a platform that facilitates the adaptation of TPS activities. Utilizing Google Docs to facilitate a TPS activity encourages students to take an active role towards investigating a teacher-prompted question in one area, collaborating with peers to add to an electronic document based on the instructor question, and finally projecting their findings on the screen to the larger group.",0.05784313725490196,0.5656162464985994

Students think about what they know or have learned about the topic for a given amount of time (usually 1-3 minutes).\n\n**Pair:**  Each student should be paired with another student. Teachers may choose whether to assign pairs or let students pick their own partner.  Remember to be sensitive to learners' needs (reading skills, attention skills, language skills) when creating pairs.  Students share their thinking with their partner, discuss ideas, and ask questions of their partner about their thoughts on the topic (2-5 minutes).\n\n**Share:**  Once partners have had ample time to share their thoughts and have a discussion, teachers expand the share into a whole-class discussion. Allow each group to choose who will present their thoughts, ideas, and questions they had to the rest of the class.

None generally go for 3rd option while some try trigonometric identities. \n\nAfter discussion students realize the graph is not the most accurate way to prove this.

To achieve these goals it is imperative that students actively engage with the curriculum and the teaching process and that they develop a motivation and discipline to learn in both group and individual settings. This strategy was developed to facilitate achievement of these goals.\nThis strategy represents our approach to delivering the best possible learning experience for students that will promote independent learning and academic achievement. In implementing the strategy departments and lecturers will strive to ensure that students are exposed to modern, effective teaching models that engage students.\n",0.2604166666666667,0.43124999999999997

5306,111775,"\n \nThink-Pair-Share is a cooperative learning strategy that can promote and support higher level thinking. The teacher asks students to think about a specific topic, pair with another student to discuss their own thinking, and then share their ideas with the group. It encourages individual participation and is applicable across all grade levels and class sizes.\n\nFrom my experience I would like to say,\nWhen students have appropriate “think time”, the quality of their responses improves.\n • Students are actively engaged in the thinking. \n• Thinking becomes more focussed when it is discussed with a partner. \n• More of the critical thinking is retained after a lesson if students have an opportunity to discuss and reflect on the topic.\n • Many students find it safer or easier to enter into a discussion with another classmate, rather than with a large group.\n • No specific materials are needed for the strategy, so it can easily be incorporated into lessons. \n• Building on the ideas of others is an important skill for students to learn.\n",0.26887755102040817,0.5579931972789115

5831,120806,"**Can TPS and PI be used as summative or formative assessment?**\n\nSummative assessment (or summative evaluation) refers to the assessment of participants where the focus is on the outcome of a program. \n\nThis contrasts with formative assessment, which summarizes the participants’ development at a particular time.\n\nSummative assessments are commonly contrasted with formative assessments, which collect detailed information that educators can use to improve instruction and student learning while it’s happening. \n\nIn other words, formative assessments are often said to be for learning, while summative assessments are of learning. \n\nOr \n\nas assessment expert Paul Black put it, “When the cook tastes the soup, that’s formative assessment. When the customer tastes the soup, that’s summative assessment.” \n\nIt should be noted, however, that the distinction between formative and summative is often fuzzy in practice, and educators may have divergent interpretations and opinions on the subject.\n\n*So if you are using TPS or PI activity during the period of instruction as a part of the lecture then it becomes formative **(for learning)** and if you are using it at the end of the course as a part of one of your final assessment technique/activity it becomes summative **(of learning)**.*\n\n\n**Within this course where have you seen application of Summative and Formative Assessments?**\n\n**Formative Assessments:**\n\n*1.\tLBD Activities*\n\n*2.\tPeer Assessments,* \n\n*3.\tSelf-Assessments,*\n\n*4.\tDiscussion Forums*\n\n\n**Summative Assessments:**\n\n*1.\tResource Creation Quizzes*\n\n*2.\tKnowledge Quizzes*\n\n*3.\tDiscussion Forums*\n\n*4.\tReflection Quizzes*\n\n\n*Here 'Discussion forum’ is the example of both formative and summative assessment.*\n\n*During discussion it gives us feedback from the peers and after discussion we use it to answer a question in RQ based on the number of responses/comments received.*\n",-0.004166666666666656,0.5652777777777778

Whereas at the subject/ course level, formative assessment could be supplemental to summative assessment but not an alternative. The reverse is also true. The students’ can get expedite feedback from peers and learning facilitator(s).

7162,34179,"***Advantage of video:*** The possibility of using Verbal, Visual, and Non-verbal cues in communication (admittedly on 100% powerpoint webinars the non-verbal aspect isn't available).  Overall more flexibility in terms of communication.  Each one of the 3 brings unique benefits to the education process and experience.    \n\n - Mirror real world.  Replicate real world scenarios better versus\n   text, visual, or just audio. \n - Multi-modality.  This is a user experience & education benefit.\n - Theoretically more engaging.\n - Probably higher perceived value.\n - You might even feel better about the finished product.\n\n***Challenges/Disadvantages of video:***\n - Time allotted.\n - Money/Resources.\n - Time to product/Learning curve of doing multi-media projects.\n \n***Advantage of Animation:***\n\n - Gets and generally keeps peoples' interest for the duration of the animation.\n - Teaches using visual aids, a very strong proven way of learning.\n - You may think this is funny, but it is serious: It gives animators work and helps them learn some science.\n - Helps to explain and illustrate more complex concepts.\n\n***Disadvantage of Animation:***\n - Some people think animations are dumb or for kids and won't pay attention and learn anything.\n - Costs money over traditional teaching methods and requires specialized resources (animators and writers).\n - Ineffective teaching/learning tool for complex interelated concepts due to its inherent simplicity.\n - Can give a false sense of safety as related to science that requires important attention to safety, such as chemistry experiments, electricity and the nuclear fields. Animations are not good for teaching safety in science.\n\n***Advantage of Simulations:*** There are two big advantages to performing a simulation rather than actually building the design and testing it. The biggest of these advantages is money. Designing, building, testing, redesigning, rebuilding, retesting,... for anything can be an expensive project. Simulations take the building/rebuilding phase out of the loop by using the model already created in the design phase. Most of the time the simulation testing is cheaper and faster than performing the multiple tests of the design each time. Considering the typical university budget cheaper is usually a very good thing. In the case of an electric thruster the test must be run inside of a vacuum tank. Vacuum tanks are very expensive to buy, run, and maintain. One of the main tests of an electric thruster is the lifetime test, which means that the thruster is running pretty much constantly inside of the vacuum tank for 10,000+ hours. This is pouring money down a drain compared to the price of the simulation.\n\nThe second biggest advantage of a simulation is the level of detail that you can get from a simulation. A simulation can give you results that are not experimentally measurable with our current level of technology. Results such as surface interactions on an atomic level, flow at the exit of a micro electric thruster, or molecular flow inside of a star are not measurable by any current devices. A simulation can give these results when problems such as it's too small to measure, the probe is too big and is skewing the results, and any instrument would turn to a gas at those temperatures come into the conversation. You can set the simulation to run for as many time steps you desire and at any level of detail you desire the only restrictions are your imagination, your programming skills, and your CPU.\n***Disadvantage of Simulations:***There are two big disadvantages to performing a simulation as well. The first of these disadvantages is simulation errors. Any incorrect key stroke has the potential to alter the results of the simulation and give you the wrong results. Also usually we are programming using theories of the way things work not laws and theories are not often 100% correct. Provided that you can get your simulation to give you accurate results you must first run a base line to prove that it works. In order for the simulation to be accepted in the general community you have to take experimental results and simulate them. If the two data sets compare, then any simulation you do of your own design will have some credibility. The other large disadvantage is the fact that it is a simulation. Many people do not consider what they do engineering unless they can see, hear, feel, and taste the project. If you are designing a light saber a typical engineer needs to be able to hold the light saber in their hand in order to consider the project worth his or her time. If you are capable of moving your craft into the virtual world of simulations you are no longer restricted by little things like reality. If you want to design a light saber in the virtual world it is not a problem, but in reality that is another matter all together.

Also writing with a digital video camera equipped with a foldable screen allows the teacher to record and show immediately to the student the default or good position that is in the centre of a sequence of teaching.\n\nLimitations of video's: It becomes difficult and expensive to do a recording of reasonable quality, considering that these students are very demanding regarding sound quality.\n\nAdvantages of animations: Animations seem to offer the advantages of delivering better representations of the concepts. Compared to static images and text, animations can present procedural information (e.g.physiological activities) more explicitly as they show the steps in an orderly manner. Animations surely explain contents more explicitly to students, make students more interested in the subjects taught.\n\nLimitations of animation: Designing and developing quality animations for teaching and learning can be challenging sometimes, people even found no improvement on students learning in using animations in their study.\n\nAdvantages of simulations: Instructional simulations can be very effective in stimulating student understanding and it works best when instructor have a clear written statement in the course syllabus about the goals of the simulation and an explanation of how the simulation is tied to the course objectives. Also here active students participation is crucial.\n\nLimitations of simulations: It is very time consuming.

They can store information easily.\n5.The training time is reduced to a great extent using videos.\n\n*Limitation*\nThere is no direct contact between the teacher and the learner so clarification of doubts will take some time.\n1.Using videos in e-learning courses can be expensive and time-consuming, for you have to spend money and hire people to script, edit and create the video.\n2.If the video created does not match up the standards of a high quality video, then it can be distracting instead of useful.\n3.There might be problem housing the video in case, you are unable to upload or embed videos directly as allowed by most of the learning management system.\n4.Videos are not useful when you want to teach concepts that are not visible to naked eye (like atoms, molecules etc). After going through the animation and simulation, go to the discussion forum and post all those similar limitations that comes to your mind.\n\n\n**2. Animation :**\n*Advantages*\nAnimations help in conveying information quickly and effectively to learners.\nAnimations like these help us in identifying details like velocity at a given instant which is not usually possible with video alone. However this is one advantage of the many that you can share. Continue going through the visualization example of simulation and then go to the discussion forum activity (next one) and post as many advantages of animations as you can think.\nLimitation\n\nSimulation :\nAdvantage\nHelps in studying the behavior of a system without building it and even helps in performing analysis with experimentation.\nInteractivity is just one of the many advantages. Go to the discussion forum activity (next one) and see how many advantages of simulations are getting listed there.\nLimitation\nExpensive to build a simulation model and as simulations portray the real situations in simple way sometimes it becomes very complex and difficult to prepare a simulation model.\n\n\n",0.17216216216216215,0.4928056628056628

While animators are quite good at creating a single-frame pose for a character, they are not as good at creating realistic motion across frames.\nAnother limitation of computer animation is that it does not stand up well to full lighting within the program.

Apply: Relate the EVEN and ODD Function using EXOR Gate.\nAns: \n1. Odd Function:In general, an exclusive-OR function of n-variables is an odd function which has a value of 1 IFF the number of 1’s in the input combination is odd, otherwise it has a value of 0. Since XOR gates are only designed with 2 inputs, the 3-input XOR function is\nimplemented by means of two 2-input XOR gates,along with truth table and symbol. \n2. Even Function: The complement of an odd function is an even function. The even function is equal to 1 when the number of 1’s in the input combination is even.\nThe complement of an odd function (an even function) is obtained by replacing the\noutput gate with an exclusive-NOR gate, along with truth table and symbol.\n4.

We do participate in a variety workshop, seminars and conferences and some of us have pursued specialist teaching qualifications. \nAll of these activities were aimed at delivering on our Strategic Plan commitments as represented in goals.\nWe try to make ourselves available for students. We have our knowledge accessible to students, we also takes care to produce an independent learner. To achieve these goals it is imperative that students actively engage with the curriculum and the teaching process and that they develop a motivation and discipline to learn in both group and individual settings. \nThis strategy was developed to facilitate achievement of these goals. This strategy represents our approach to delivering the best possible learning experience for students that will promote independent learning and academic achievement. In implementing the strategy departments and lecturers will strive to ensure that students are exposed to modern, effective teaching models that engage students.\nLet us summarize the discussion as follows: \nOBJECTIVES: articulate the knowledge and skills we want students to acquire by the end of the course \nASSESSMENTS: allow the instructor to check the degree to which the students are meeting the learning objectives \nINSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES are chosen to foster student learning towards meeting the objectives. When these components are not aligned, students might rightfully complain that the test did not have anything to do with what was covered in class, or instructors might feel that even though students are earning a passing grade, they haven’t really mastered the material at the desired level.\n",0.2572916666666667,0.38125

To summarize means to reduce the most essential points of someone else’s work into a shorter form. Along with quotation, paraphrase and summary provide the main tools for integrating your sources into your papers. When choosing which to use, consider first your discipline and the type of writing in which you are engaged. For example, literature reviews in science reports rely almost exclusively on summary. Argumentative essays, by contrast, rely on all three tools.\n\nParaphrase and summary are indispensable in argumentative papers because they allow you to include other people’s ideas without cluttering up your paragraphs with quotations. These techniques help you take greater control of your essay. Consider using either tool when an idea from one of your sources is important to your essay but the wording is not. Space limitations may guide you in your choice. But above all, think about how much of the detail from your source is relevant to your argument. If your reader needs to know only the bare bones, then summarize.\n\nThough paraphrase and summary are often preferable to quotation, do not rely too heavily on them, either.

11540,115346,"URL : http://www.fefana.org/ClassTool/\n Segmentation and classification tools provide an approach to extracting features from imagery based on objects. These objects are created via an image segmentation process where pixels in close proximity and having similar spectral characteristics are grouped together into a segment. Segments exhibiting certain shapes, spectral, and spatial characteristics can be further grouped into objects. The objects can then be grouped into classes that represent real-world features on the ground. Image classification can also be performed on pixel imagery, for example, traditional unsegmented imagery.\n\nThe object-oriented feature extraction process is a workflow supported by tools covering three main functional areas; image segmentation, deriving analytical information about the segments, and classification. Data output from one tool is the input to subsequent tools, where the goal is to produce a meaningful object-oriented feature class map. The object-oriented process is similar to a traditional image, pixel-based classification process, utilizing supervised and unsupervised classification techniques. Instead of classifying pixels the process classifies segments, which can be thought of as super pixels. Each segment, or super pixel, is represented by a set of attributes that are used by the classifier tools to produce the classified image.",0.14069264069264067,0.508008658008658

11569,115346,"CONCEPT\nURL : http://www.digitaltutors.com/subject/2d-animation-tutorials\nHow Animated Movies Are Made\n\nWhat is animation? Animation is the art of brining something to life. How it's brought to life can be done any number of different ways. It can be drawn, like Mike Surrey here to the right. You can make a model of it and move it, like in ""The Nightmare Before Christmas."" You can put it on a computer, like Toy Story. Or you can cut out bits of paper and move the paper, like (yech) South Park (the original one anyways). You can even move whole people around, photographing them one frame at a time, so they can move without walking. All of these are different forms of animation.\n\nHow it all gets started - Pre-Production\n\nAnimated movies start much the same way normal movies do. Someone has an idea, that idea gets accepted by a bunch of studio heads, and the studio starts working on it. Ron Clements talks about how ""Aladdin"" got started in Aladdin: the making of an animated film:\n\n    ""When we finished Mermaid, we didn't know what we were going to do next. Jeffrey [Katzenburg] offered us three projects. One was Swan Lake. Another was King of the Jungle [which later became The Lion King]. The third was Aladdin. Swan Lake seemed too much like Mermaid, which we had just finished, so it was between King of the Jungle and Aladdin. Aladdin seemed like the most fun.""\n\nSo much for inspiration. The directors then go on to write out their version of story. The story is discussed and refined (Jasmin's age, for example, was switched from ""15"" to ""indeterminate"" when Jeffery Katzenburg decided that they should send out the message that it was all right to get married at age 15!). At the same time, research crews are sent out to the ""location"" of the film, be it Africa for The Lion King or China for Mulan, so that they'll have something to boast about on the ABC Special just before the film comes out. But seriously, the artists take pictures, make sketches and, well, enjoy themselves (this is the good part of making a movie!) and do play an important role in developing the look and feel of the film. Back at the studio, artists are making inspirational sketches (see pictures on this page) suggesting mood, setting, characters and plot for the movie. Some of these inspirational sketches may also be adapted to become story sketches later in production.\n\nJobs in Pre-production:\n\n    Inspirational artist\n    Any other artist at a studio can participate in this stage\n\nProduction and Story- The real work begins\n\nMany films never make it past the pre-production stage. Films such as ""Hiawatha"" and ""Chanticlere"" are now fading memories in the minds of those who conceived them; they were never made into movies. However, those lucky movies that are given the go-ahead by management now go into production. Production in animation is not like production in live-action, where you just go out, shoot the picture and come home. Well, okay, it is, sort of, but it takes a lot longer. Jurassic Park was in production for about 80 or so days; the bulk of the time was done in pre and post production (the puppet dinosaurs were created in pre and the computer ones were added in post, if you must know). An animated film, however, will be in full production much longer; the shortest was The Great Mouse Detective, which took a year.\n\nSo, what's the first stage of production? The storyboards are the first things to be created. A storyboard is basically a giant bristol board, on which you can tack story sketches, which are (surprise!) sketches which illustrate the story. What these boards do is show roughly how every scene in the movie will look. It looks nothing so much like a giant comic strip, with the exception that the dialogue, instead of being included in the drawing, is separated out and put below. (Note: the movie scripts are either written at the same time or slightly before the storyboards. However, the two undergo constant revisions at the same time, so it is fair to say they go together.) The dialogue is also recorded at this time - it too will often undergo revisions. The reason the storyboards are pinned up, in case you haven't guessed, is so that they can be easily torn down, as they often are when the story changes. An entire version of Be Our Guest in ""Beauty and the Beast"" was scrapped when the story was not working; so were all the story sketches on that part of the boards.",0.18994581807081806,0.45445665445665434

We have our knowledge accessible to students, we also takes care to produce an independent learner. To achieve these goals it is imperative that students actively engage with the curriculum and the teaching process and that they develop a motivation and discipline to learn in both group and individual settings. This strategy was developed to facilitate achievement of these goals. This strategy represents our approach to delivering the best possible learning experience for students that will promote independent learning and academic achievement. In implementing the strategy departments and lecturers will strive to ensure that students are exposed to modern, effective teaching models that engage students.

It is important to note that, similar to the Classification by Interaction model, this model is really describing the learning activities enabled by the technologies rather than the technologies themselves. Graham astutely points out that most types of technology-based learning activities cannot be easily put into bins, but rather fall somewhere on scale of a particular variable. Thus this categorization method is perhaps the most effective, albeit perhaps a bit more complicated than is necessary for less experienced users.\n**2.

14052,114268,"Structuring:\n\nCognitive tools help learners with complex cognitive learning activities and critical thinking. These tools are learner controlled in the sense that they construct their knowledge themselves using the tools rather than memorizing knowledge. In this perspective, computer systems are partners that stimulate learners or groups of learners to make maximum use of their cognitive potential.\nWeb 2.0 reflect s a shift in leading-edge applications on the World Wide Web, a shift from the presentation of material by website providers (Web 1.0) to the active co-construction of resources by communities of contributors with interactive media. Whereas the twentieth-century web revolved around developer-created material (e.g., informational websites) generated mainly by a small fraction of the Internet’s users, Web 2.0 tools (e.g., Wikipedia) help large numbers of people build online communities for creativity, collaboration, and sharing. And with web application programming interfaces, community-builders do not need specialized technical expertise to create new media/information.\n\nDeconstructing:\nAn analytic tool for deconstructing \n\nTHE MODEL AS AN ANALYTICAL TOOL IN RESEARCH\n\nThe model has been used as teaching material in teaching methodology courses for distance learning and on-campus undergraduates and graduates. There is always an Aha! moment when the model is presented on a piece of paper and it is simply folded in half so that the white frames are on one half and the grey frames on the other. It has also been used as a tool in the design of research methodology courses. Most recently it has been used as the basis of several chapters in a handbook written for teachers taking their first steps in distance learning \nHere several applications of the model in recent research situations will be discussed. The seven frames of the model focus attention simultaneously on the teacher and learner and each frame is a window into a world of choices and situations, which must be taken into account when making teaching decisions. The view differs according to the contexts in which we work and the assumptions that we make about the way in which students learning.\n\nMashing:\n\nTwiddla \n\nTwiddle provides a really easy to use collaborative online whiteboard. This “no setup web based meeting playground” is quick and easy – inviting others to collaborate by just hitting the green GO button to start a session and then use the Invite option. This app provides a great set of tools.\n \nGoogle Drive \n\nMost of you are probably already familiar with Google Drive, which lets you share and collaboratively edit Google Docs with anyone else who has a Google account, for free. Sweet. Being able to collaboratively edit documents and worksheets opens up a world of possibilities for interactive classroom activities and projects.\n\n3. Bubbl.us \n\nThis free tool* allows users to easily create bubble maps, that can be exported in various formats, saved (by exporting and re-importing them in an appropriate format), and yes … edited collaboratively. The use of bubble maps as a teaching tool has been a good practice for decades, but bringing it to a new level by enabling collaborative editing through an online tool is totally 21st century\n",0.1510491822991823,0.43226310726310735

Other professionals were incorporated from cognitive science, ethnography, and library science (to name a few).

User-centric approaches were developed resulting in the creation of whole workflow systems to accommodate diversity in skills and tools.
